CodeFlow Engine is a platform study for the App Engine Framework to develop mobile and desktop-based applications. Solutions are distributed in multi-layer extensions. The goal is to make the common functions reusable for the solution and to reduce the complexity of specific adaptation through decoupling. The foundations for the software architecture are provided by dotnet development platform, the programming language C# and the open source library Uno Platform. To support a rapid application development approach, Frigma Design can be imported via Uno Platform. The main inspiration for this app engine is sophisticated game engines.
